## ✨ Features

- 🎥 Real-time webcam-based gesture detection  
- ⚡ Instant prediction with minimal latency  
- 🧠 Machine Learning model trained on hand landmarks  
- 🔤 Converts gestures into text output  
- 📊 Confidence score display  
- 🧾 Gesture history tracking  
- 🌑 Clean modern UI (monochrome theme)

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React (Vite + TypeScript)
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion

### Backend
- FastAPI (Python)
- Uvicorn

### Machine Learning
- MediaPipe (hand tracking)
- Scikit-learn (RandomForest)

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Webcam captures hand gesture
2. MediaPipe extracts hand landmarks (21 points)
3. Features are processed into a vector
4. Trained ML model predicts the gesture
5. Output is displayed in real-time
